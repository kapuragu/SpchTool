SpchTool
========
A tool for decompiling and compiling MGSV .spch TppSpeechData files, created using youarebritish's LbaTool source code.
https://github.com/youarebritish/LbaTool

Requirements
--------
```
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 
```

Usage
--------
Drag and drop one or more .spch files onto the .exe to unpack them to .spch.xml files. Do the same with .spch.xml files to repack them into .spch format.
The sbpListId and sbpVoiceClipId are found in .sbp soundbanks' HIRC sections, which you'll still have to get manually, as Wwise soundbanks in MGSV still need documentation and tooling.

Credits
--------
Huge thanks to youarebritish for helping me learn how to use this and allowing me use the LbaTool source!
